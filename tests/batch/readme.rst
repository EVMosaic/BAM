Batch Tests
***********

These tests aren't meant to be executed in an isolated manner (as with unit-tests).

They are meant to run against real blender projects, checking the output is valid.

So for example we can point a batch test at a large repository containing ``.blend`` files
and check that we can manipulate the files, keeping them valid.
